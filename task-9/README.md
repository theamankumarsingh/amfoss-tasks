# Spammer_Spaghetti
I would rate this task a medium because I don't know JavaScript.
I went though the links and learnt bit of syntaxes which would help me do this task. Even went to JQuery section and learnt few commands just to make things simpler for me.

About the code:
1. **speed** variable is used to control speed at which messages are sent (in milliseconds). Default value assigned is 50ms. (Pretty fast, huh?)
2. spam function is used to spam the **message** into the chat box and send it. I used JQuery to click (mousedown) the send button (".btn" is the class name I got when I inspected the element)
3. **setInterval** is used to loop over and over again until the script is stopped.
