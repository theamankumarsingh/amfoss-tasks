# Debugging Derbies
This task was easy as Java is my primary language (I started programming with this).

Errors fixed:
1. Semicolons XD
2. fixed commented import
3. fixed illegal comments
4. corrected comments not making sense (just for sake of reader)
5. corrected illegal syntaxes (for example: JPanel -> JPanel())
6. interchanged start - stop message, any wrong message
7. corrected wrong mathematics
8. corrected wrong variable updates (score part)
9. fixed certain situations like empty inputs, illegal inputs, etc. using try-catch and little modifications
10. Any similar bug(s) is fixed

I took care not to change the main logic of code as best as I could.
