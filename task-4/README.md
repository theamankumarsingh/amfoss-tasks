This task was also easy as Java is my primary language (I started programming with this).

Errors fixed:
1. Semicolons XD
2. fixed commented import
3. fixed illegal comments
4. corrected comments not making sense (just for sake of reader)
5. correctly illegal syntaxes (for example: JPanel -> JPanel())
6. stop-start interchange
7. corrected wrong arithematics
8. corrected wrong variable updates (score part)
9. fixed certain situations like empty inputs, illegal inputs, etc using try catch and little modifications
10. Any similar bug is fixed

I took care not to change the main logic of code as best as I can.
I hope Lenna is pleased with my work ;)
