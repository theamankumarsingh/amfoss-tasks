This question was moderate.

I first found the derivative of the given function. It had the complex form of tan(x) and all. I figured out that I cannot find local minima by differentiation method (the calculation would be very complex).

The very first algorithm that came to my mind was gradient descend. So I implemented that using ternary search (often used to find maxima and minima of curves).

## How the code works
