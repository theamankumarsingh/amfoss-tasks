# Sir Percevalâ€™s quest
Easy task.

After reading the documentation given in link (and doing some surfing on web), I was able to write the script.

Used os package to use system function and execute linux shell commands.

Used requests to get request from the github api. I then displayed the list to see what format the data is in. I found out it was a list of dictionary, and thus found that each dictionary element has a "name" which contained the repo name. I then used that to access name elements and execute the commands.

I also displayed the file using **cat** command after writing to commits.json file just to make life of my seniors easy :)
