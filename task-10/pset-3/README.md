## PSET-3
This problem was good.

I read the piano terminology to understand how semitone is related to each lettering and numbers. I soon figured out the pattern.

In the program, I used the same concept to compute n (number of semitones). Then using the given formula and all, I was easily able to write helpers.c . The real trick was to figure out seeing the piano what each Letter (A to G), symbol (b or #) and number mean. Rest, programming was easy.

By seeing the musical sheet for "Happy Birthday", one can easily figure out what each symbol meant. Thus, I was able to convert the sheet into computer understandable script in bday.txt .
