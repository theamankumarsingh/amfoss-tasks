## PSET-2
Pset-2 was mostly easy.

1. Caesar program uses simple alphabet shifting to encrypt the message.

2. Vigenere is similar to Caesar, except it uses value of each letter of key to encrypt the message.

3. Crack program uses brute force method to crack the given password. It generates a candidate password, then computes its hash, and finally compare with the password hash to verify. If match found, congrats! password found, else, next iteration.
