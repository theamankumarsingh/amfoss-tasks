## Smallest multiple
In a nutshell, we are required to find LCM of numbers 1 to N.

## How the code works?
We can compute LCM pair by pair starting from 1 and 2, then resultant multiple with 3, and so on. To compute LCM of a pair, we can use formula LCM= A * B / HCF.

To compute HCF we can use Euclid's Division Lemma, implemented via recursion.
